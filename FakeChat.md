# FakeChat: The Ultimate Anonymous Prank Chat Experience

FakeChat is a room-based, fully anonymous chat application designed for pranks and group fun. It combines the sleek, premium feel of high-end messaging apps like Telegram with the chaotic energy of total anonymity.

## 🚀 Core Concept

FakeChat allows users to create private digital rooms where identity is fluid. By sharing a unique 6-character code or URL, friends can join a room and send messages without any persistent identity. You can be anyone—literally. Change your display name on every message to keep your friends guessing.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🔏 Absolute Anonymity

- **Identity Fluidity:** No user accounts, registration, or authentication required.
- **On-the-Go Identity:** Change your display name directly from the message typing box before hitting send.
- **Privacy by Design:** No records of original identities are stored on the server. Even the developer won't know who sent what.

### 2. 📱 Premium Mobile-First Experience

- **Native-Like Feel:** Though a web app, the experience is optimized to feel like a native mobile application.
- **Fluid UI/UX:** Buttery smooth animations and transitions for a high-end feel.
- **Gesture Navigation:**
    - **Swipe Right:** Quick reply to others' messages.
    - **Swipe Left:** Quick reply to your own messages.

### 3. 🏠 Room Management

- **Home Screen:** A minimalist landing page with two primary actions: **Create Room** and **Join Room**.
- **Create Room:** Requires a room name and the creator's "original" identifier (so friends know who invited them).
- **Join Room:** Access via a unique 6-character alphanumeric code.
- **Room Info:** A dedicated info panel in-chat to view room details and the creator's name.

### 4. 🎨 Design Aesthetics

- **Theme:** Premium Deep Dark. Not absolute black, but a sophisticated, sleek dark palette that emphasizes depth and clarity.
- **Minimalism:** A clean, eye-catching interface that stays out of the way of the conversation.
- **Telegram-Inspired:** High-quality shadows, rounded corners, and refined typography.

## 🛠 Planned Functionality

- **Top Navigation Bar:**
    - **Back Button:** Return to the main menu.
    - **Identity Display:** Shows your current active display name.
    - **Info Button:** Access room metadata and creator identity.
- **Chat Interface:**
    - **Message Bubbles:** Clear distinction between sender identities (while remaining anonymous).
    - **Reply Context:** Visual indicators for swiped replies.
    - **Name Switcher:** Integrated seamlessly into the input field.
